# Jive Simple Stream Integration Generator

You can easily create a Jive Simple Stream Integration using this form that auto-generates the package for you (in the form of a Jive add-on). All you need to do is write the transform function in JavaScript. Once you have the add-on package, you can upload it to your Jive community.
